      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Inspired by an Instagram post with a single image
        and a detailess description with little more than the title. Amy was inspired
        and we went from there to recreate the dish.</p>
        <p>In the two times we've made it since we've not used rotini, and our
        ricotta was expired before we could use it. <strong>Beware soft cheese.</strong></p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 tube of chorizo <em>(pork or beef is fine, I perfer pork)</em></li>
          <li>16 oz of pasta <em>(we use penne or mafaldine)</em></li>
          <li>1 cup of red pasta sauce <em>(you could substitute crushed tomatoes)</em></li>
          <li>Ricotta on hand as topping</li>
          <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
          <li>Vaguley italian seasoning or fresh herbs</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Begin by cooking your pasta until soft and chewy a.k.a Amy Style</li>
          <li>Chop garlic finely</li>
          <li>While your pasta boils, brown your chorizo and garlic in a pan</li>
          <li>Add your sauce or tomatoes to your chorizo without draining the fat</li>
          <li>Drain and rinse your pasta then toss in the pan with your chorizo-sauce</li>
          <li>Plate pasta, garnish with vaguely italian seasoning or fresh herbs</li>
          <li>Top with pasta to personal prference</li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
